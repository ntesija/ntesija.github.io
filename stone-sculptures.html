   <h1>stone sculptures</h1>

   <p>
      I have begun sculpting stone. I currently have a few pieces that I've completed and some in progress.
   </p>

   <div class="container">
      <div class="section">
         <h2>001 - abstract marble</h2>
         <img width="300px" src="images/marble.jpg" alt="an abstract sculpture made from marble"></img>
         <p>
            this was my first piece I made. I learned a lot about working with smaller pieces, filing stone down, and
            sanding. it now resides somewhere in my parent's house
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
         <h2>002 - alabaster love</h2>
         <img width="300px" src="images/alabaster-guz.jpg"
            alt="an abstract sculpture made from alabaster. it resembles a heart and a butt"></img>
         <p>
            my second piece was made out of alabaster. alabaster is really soft and I learned a lot about how easy it
            is to bruise stone with chisels. this one is in my flat
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
         <h2>003 - relaxed nude</h2>
         <img width="300px" src="images/other_marble.jpg"
            alt="a sculpture made from marble showing a nude male figure"></img>
         <p>
            the third piece I made is a larger marble sculpture. I was still learning about bruising stone with chisels
            and this one has very clear signs in the tight areas. this one lives in my flat
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
         <h2>004 - alabaster love 2</h2>
         <img width="300px" src="images/alabaster-kur.jpg"
            alt="a sculpture made from alabaster featuring an erect penis"></img>
         <p>
            this one is uh... probably my best work but also the one I don't like to show people? it's made from the
            same alabaster as the second piece and they kinda fit together. it's hidden in my flat
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
         <h2>005 - migraine</h2>
         <img width="300px" src="images/migraine.jpg"
            alt="a sculpture depicting a head being held by a hand with brains oozing out of it"></img>
         <p>
            this is my biggest piece yet. I started this piece without knowing where I was going. it's still a work in
            progress but it's almost complete (as of june 2025). I BELIEVE this is limestone, but it might be alabaster.
            I have to do some tests on the stone to figure out what it is because I don't really recall what type of
            stone I bought. this is also the first piece that doesn't depict genitalia
