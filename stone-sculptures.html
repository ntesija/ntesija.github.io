      <h1>stone sculptures</h1>

      <p class="intro">
         Here are my stone sculptures I've created. I currently have a few pieces that I've completed and some in
         progress.
         I don't use
         any power tools so everything is done painstakingly by hand. I use a mallet and a few chisels to rough out the
         shape then I use rasps and files to smooth out the details. From there I sand using silicon carbide sandpaper
         to
         get a smooth glossy finish. Generally the sanding takes the longest, sometimes up to a whole month of studio
         time.

            <h3>WIP</h3>
            <p>
               I'm trying something new with this piece. I want to see if I can save time and sanity by doing as much as
               possible with the chisels instead of rasping/sanding for a super long time. I think it's a bit easier on
               this piece beacuse it's not marble (I <i>think</i> its limestone) which means it takes less force to
               carve it. Anyways I'm quite happy with this piece so far, hands are quite difficult in most art forms,
               stone is no different.

            <p>
               this is my biggest piece yet. I started this piece without knowing where I was going. I BELIEVE this is
               limestone, but it might be alabaster.
               I have to do some tests on the stone to figure out what it is because I don't really recall what type of
               stone I bought. this is also the first piece that doesn't depict genitalia

               I started this piece in San Francisco and then finished it after moving to London.

               this one is uh... probably my best work but also the one I don't like to show people? it's made from the
               same alabaster as the second piece and they kinda fit together. a lot of the work on this was done with
               rasps and sand paper as it was too small and fragile to hit with a chisel.

            <h3>June 2024</h3>
            <p>
               the third piece I made is a larger marble sculpture. I was still learning about bruising stone with
               chisels and this one has very clear signs in the tight areas.

               the idea for this piece was derived from the form
               of the original stone when I bought it. I couldn't unsee the large triangular part on the original stone
               as being what it ended up being so the form of the stone dictated the sculpture.

               my second piece was made out of alabaster. alabaster is really soft and I learned a lot about how easy it
               is to bruise stone with chisels. i actually finished this one before I finished the first piece as it was
               easier to work with alabaster than it was to work with marble. this piece broke a few times which taught
               me that with stone, if it breaks, you just get two sculptures instead of one.

               this was the first piece I made. I learned a lot about working with smaller pieces, filing stone down,
               and
               sanding. this was a piece of scrap marble that was available at the studio I took classes at. I almost
               didn't add the hole in the middle of the sculpture because I figured it would break in half. After a
               while I realized that the sculpture would be incomplete without it so I did it anyways and it did not
               break. Marble is very tough
