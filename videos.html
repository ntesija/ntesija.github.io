   <h1>videos</h1>

   <p>
      I often walk around with my hi8 video camera and film random things. I try to capture the essence of
      old family videos.

            I made a movie called Sonder. It follows 8 people through San Francisco as they film parts
            of their day. It arose from me wanting to see what other people were doing with their days
            as I was feeling like I was not doing enough. It was really uplifting to see that everyone
            else was doing just about the same things I was doing too.

            This is a video of a trip I took to Bristol. I have moved to London and am enjoying exploring
            the surrounding countries. I added some very simple music over top of the video because it felt
            like it needed some ambient music.

            This is a video I took of random things including me and the streets of San Francisco. I
            have a
            lot of videos like this because I often get bored and wander around the city.
