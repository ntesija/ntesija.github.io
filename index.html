                I work at Google on Search, making it a pretty website as a front end engineer.

                I make music under the name NNIK. It used to be Nautical Nik, but then someone said it sounded like I
                would be singing sea shanties (which would be cool but I don't). I like to make simple sounding songs
                that evoke the same feeling as using the spray can tool in MS Paint (they're ok). I hate my voice but I
                still sing.

                    I take pictures on 35mm film cameras for fun. Mostly of my friends, but some times I take pictures
                    of
                    other
                    things too.

                            This is a picture I took on film of some payphones near Morro Bay. Kinda cool and eerie to
                            see
                            that this stuff is still lying around. I had a realization recently that I don't think I
                            ever
                            actually used a pay phone as a kid.

                            picnic in Napa. We ate a lot of bread and cheese and drank a lot of wine.

                    I often walk around with my hi8 video camera and film random things. I try to capture the essence of

                            have a
                            lot of videos like this because I often get bored and wander around the city.

                    My brother is an amazing 2d artist so I wanted to do something different. I decided to begin

                        I recently started learning to sculpt marble. I'm not good at it yet so I don't have any
                        pictures.
                        It's a fun hobby that results in me using half of the trunk space in my car to store a block of
                        alabaster that I may never use.

                        I also just started to learn how to cast molds of things in plastic, often things I mold out of
                        clay. I am not quite good enough to share my creations as I keep making bad molds or ugly casts.
                        Hopefully I will be able to make something cool soon.
