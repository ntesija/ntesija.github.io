                I worked at Google on Search, making it a pretty website as a front end engineer.
                This website is my attempt to live life without Figma mocks or a javascript framework, everything is
                vanilla js.

                I make music under the name NNIK. It used to be Nautical Nik, but then someone said it sounded like I
                would be singing sea shanties (which would be cool but I don't). I like to make simple sounding songs
                that evoke the same feeling as using the spray can tool in MS Paint (they're ok). I hate my voice but I
                still sing.

                            I made a movie called Sonder. It follows 8 people through San Francisco as they film parts
                            of their day. It arose from me wanting to see what other people were doing with their days
                            as I was feeling like I was not doing enough. It was really uplifting to see that everyone
                            else was doing just about the same things I was doing too.

                        I recently started learning to sculpt stone.
                        It's a fun hobby that results in me using half of the trunk space in my car to store a block of
                        alabaster or marble that I may never use. This is a picture of my first two marble pieces I
                        made.

                    I take pictures on 35mm film cameras for fun. Mostly of my friends, but some times I take pictures
                    of
                    other
                    things too.

                            that this stuff is still lying around. I had a realization recently that I don't think I
                            ever
                            actually used a pay phone as a kid.
